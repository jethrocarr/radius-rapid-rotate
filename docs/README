RADIUS RAPID ROTATE
-------------------

Radius Rapid Rotate (R3) is a small utility that is called by cron regularly
to browse the directory structure of the FreeRadius accounting logs and rotate
the files.

The time frequency of the rotation is determined by cron, R3 only concerns itself
with the correct rotation of the log files.

There is basic locking logic to advise if an admin does something that leads to
multiple instances of the process running at the same time (something that is
possible if the log rotation involves moving large files between block storage
systems - eg local disk to NFS).

R3 initially moves the file to a different temporary folder on the same file system,
ensuring that FreeRadius handles the file rotation correctly. It then does a copy &
delete to the final archival location, which works correctly for externally mounted
filesystems.

Behaviour is somewhat configurable, execute with -h for options and details.
